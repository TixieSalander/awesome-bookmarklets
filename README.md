# Awesome Bookmarklets
**Repository gathering my personal bookmarklets**

## What's a bookmarklet?

<figure>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>A bookmarklet is a bookmark stored in a web browser that contains JavaScript commands that add new features to the browser. They are stored as the URL of a bookmark in a web browser or as a hyperlink on a web page. Bookmarklets are usually small snippets of JavaScript executed when user clicks on them. When clicked, bookmarklets can perform a wide variety of operations, such as running a search query from selected text or extracting data from a table.</i></p>
